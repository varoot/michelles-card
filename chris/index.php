		Hey Michelle!
		I'm so glad that I got to know you before you left even if it was only for a couple of months.
		It was awesome to serve with you and I was really blessed by the heart that you have for people. 
		You were an amazing older sister and really helped webteam feel like a family. I pray for safe travels 			
		as you head back to Korea, and that you won't forget all the things God's done for you here. 
		Thanks for everything and hopefully we'll see each other again! (like at a wedding maybe :D)
